This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React with Google Map 

### `Introduction`

This repo is all about integration of of google map with React JS. There are many method of implementing it but this is one of the simplest method I have introduced regarding google map with React JS.

### `Steps`
* Create .env file and add google map key on "REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAP_KEY".
* npm install/yarn for installing dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
